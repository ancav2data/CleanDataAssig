RAW DATASET
====================
The original (raw ) data was Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset (Version 1.0).

for more information about the original data sets read the readme.txt file associated with the original data
======================
TIDY DATASET
======================

contains one data set that contains a table with 68 columns and 180 rows.

the data in this table corresponds to 30 subjects that performed 6 types of activities. for each subject that performed a specific activity  a set of 66 measurements were saved.
the 66 measurements are described by the names of the columns 3rd to 68th of the table.
There are 33 signals from thr original dataset for which only the mean and standard deviation were saved. The signals and their units are as follow:
*note: '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
 NAME					UNITS
tBodyAcc-XYZ 			g
tGravityAcc-XYZ			g
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ		g/second
tBodyGyro-XYZ			radians/second
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ		radians/second/second
tBodyAccMag			g
tGravityAccMag			g
tBodyAccJerkMag			g/second
tBodyGyroMag			radians/second
tBodyGyroJerkMag		radians/second/second
fBodyAcc-XYZ			Hz
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ		Hz
fBodyGyro-XYZ			Hz
fBodyAccMag			Hz
fBodyAccJerkMag			Hz
fBodyGyroMag			Hz
fBodyGyroJerkMag		Hz
 

analysis process:

Step 1: combine the train data set and the test data set in one data set
stack the data from X_train and X_test in X_data
do the same for y_train and y_test and get y_data
repeat for data from subject type files (subject_train and subject_test)

Step 2:  Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

Step 3: calculate the the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
